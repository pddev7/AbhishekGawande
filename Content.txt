I didn't even knew I was a good photographer until I got into engineering. I first picked up the camera when 
I was in my first year of engineering but, when I first picked up the camera it felt great and when I took 
the photos and looked at it I realized my art. Since then 
I have been taking photos and will continue to do so. I take photos when I'm happy,
 I take photos when I'm sad, in short, I take photos anytime.......photographer

I am an Electronics and Telecommunication engineering graduate. As I like to play with camera, I like to play with circuits too. Also 
I know some aspects of image processing, as it was one of my subjects during engineering and it really 
helps when it comes to editing an image. Now I am pursuing my career in Engineering field,
 but I hope soon I'll turn into a full time photographer.................Abhishek

 I am an engineer photographer. May be that is the reason I approach photography in creative way, 
 as creativity is in the blood of every engineer. I am doing photography from past 4 years and still learning minute aspects about it. 
 I like nature photography and wildlife photography. Hope you will like my 'Creative Photography'. Waiting for your comments :)
